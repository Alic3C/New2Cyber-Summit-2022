## Event Info & Code of Conduct
### Rules of Engagement (ROE)
READ ALL OF THESE RULES - Every part of this is important!
- If a target in the system is dorked or taken down, please do adequate testing before reaching out, we will restore it as fast as possible but it may cost you valuable playing time.
- The first player to complete all challenges listed on the CTF scoreboard will win.
- If no one completes all the challenges within the allotted time, then points will be used to determine the winner. If more than one player at the end of the CTF are tied in point value, submission times of flags by team will be used to determine which team was first to the high score.

Do not ask for hints.
- Hints will only be dropped at the discretion of the admins for challenges with zero solves. We are using the board to track your progress through the CTF. Depending on progress we will drop a hint to encourage progression through the scenario. We will give a warning of at least 5 minutes before hints are given - hints will be provided in the Discord channel.

Not In Scope // Off Limits // Do Not Attack :
- CTF Scoreboard
- Attacking other players
- Attacking any network other than what is provided in the challenge descriptions
