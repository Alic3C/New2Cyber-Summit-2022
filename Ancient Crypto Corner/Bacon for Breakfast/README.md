## Briefing
> Baconâ€™s cipher or the Baconian cipher is a method of steganography (a method of hiding a secret message as opposed to just a cipher) devised by Francis Bacon in 1605. A message is concealed in the presentation of text, rather than its content. The Baconian cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter is replaced by a sequence of 5 characters.There are two versions of this cipher. We have collected a chart for one of them.
