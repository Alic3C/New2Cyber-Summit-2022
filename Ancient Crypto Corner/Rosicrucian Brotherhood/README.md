## Briefing
> Between 1614 and 1617, three anonymous manifestos were published, first in Germany and later throughout Europe. The manifestos caused excitement throughout Europe by declaring the existence of a secret brotherhood of alchemists and sages who were preparing to transform the arts and sciences, and religious, political, and intellectual landscapes of Europe. They released a cipher which is known to be a variation of the pigpen cipher. We have collected a chart that maps each symbol to a letter for this cipher.
